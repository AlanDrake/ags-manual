<h1>Run-time engine setup<a class="headerlink" href="#run-time-engine-setup" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>The engine Setup program allows the player to customize certain game
settings.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> currently setup program is featured only for Windows.</p>
<p>The options in setup are divided into two parts: common and advanced.
Advanced options could be accessed by pressing “Advanced” button.</p>
<p><strong>Graphics settings</strong></p>
<p>Driver</p>
<p>Lets player choose a graphics driver. Currently supported are Software
renderer (old and slower one, but only driver that fully supports 8-bit
games), Direct3D 9 and OpenGL (newer and faster drivers with hardware
acceleration).</p>
<p>Run in the window instead of fullscreen</p>
<p>If checked, the game will be run in windowed mode, as opposed to
fullscreen.</p>
<p>Mode</p>
<p>Lets choose a fullscreen display mode (otherwise shows the approximate
size of window the game will be running in). The list of modes depends
on graphic card and system capabilities.</p>
<p>Fullscreen scale</p>
<p>Windowed scale</p>
<p>These two options determine the way game will be scaled (when required)
in fullscreen and windowed modes respectively:</p>
<p><strong>None</strong>. The game will be shown in its native resolution. Note that
low-resolution games will be running in a tiniest window on modern
monitors, so this choice is more suitable for high-resolution games.</p>
<p><strong>Max round multiplier</strong>. The game will be scaled up using a maximal
round integer (2, 3, 4, etc) multiplier with which it still fits inside
the screen.</p>
<p><strong>Stretch to fit screen</strong>. The game will be stretched to fill whole
screen. Note that if the game’s native aspect ratio is different from
screen one’s, the game image will appear deformed.</p>
<p><strong>Stretch to fit screen (preserve aspect ratio)</strong>. The game will be
stretched to screen borders while respecting game’s native aspect ratio
(width/height proportions). This ensures that game image will always
look correct, but may cause black borders appear at the left&amp;right or
top&amp;bottom sides of the screen.</p>
<p>Scaling method</p>
<p>Here player may choose a game scaling algorithm (nearest-neighbour is
the simpliest one). Some of the methods (notably Hqx) are restricted to
which scaling multiplier they may use; if it is not enough to resize the
game on its own, the nearest-neighbour method will be applied
additionally. The list of available filters depend on graphics driver
selection.</p>
<p><strong>Gameplay settings</strong></p>
<p>Game language</p>
<p>Here player may choose one of the available game translations.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced graphics options</strong></p>
<p>Vertical sync</p>
<p>This option enables vertical synchronisation mode, which reduces
“tearing” effect on game image, but may decrease the game running speed.</p>
<p>Use 85 Hz display</p>
<p>This option sets the monitor refresh rate to 85 Hz to run the game,
which eliminates flicker. However, this does not work on all monitors,
and not at all on flat panel displays, which is why it is disabled by
default.</p>
<p>Smooth scaled sprites</p>
<p>This option will apply anti-aliasing to scaled characters, in order to
give a smoother look to the resizing. This can slow down the game
though, so it is off by default.</p>
<p>Downgrade 32-bit graphics to 16-bit</p>
<p>This option is only available for 32-bit games. It allows people with
slower PCs to choose to play the game at 16-bit instead, in order to
boost performance. If they use this, the graphical quality will reduce,
but it should at least allow them to play the game at a decent speed.</p>
<p>Render sprites at screen resolution</p>
<p>When enabled, characters and objects are scaled in screen pixels rather
than game pixels. What this means is that when low-resolution game is
run in larger window, sprites will take advantage of this higher
resolution and look less pixelated when scaled down. This option may be
locked to certain state by the game itself (according to author’s
choice), in which case players will not be able to change it.</p>
<p><strong>Sound options</strong></p>
<p>Digital sound</p>
<p>Here player may choose the digital audio driver, or disable digital
sound completely.</p>
<p>MIDI music</p>
<p>Here player may choose the MIDI music playback method, or disable MIDI
music completely.</p>
<p>Use voice pack is available</p>
<p>When checked, this option enables voice speech in game (where
available).</p>
<p><strong>Mouse options</strong></p>
<p>Auto lock to window</p>
<p>If this option is enabled, the mouse will be locked inside game window
whenever player clicks on it or switches into game. The locked mouse
cannot leave game window, making it impossible to switch out from the
game by mistake (by clicking on desktop, for example). Naturally, this
option only has importance if game is run in windowed mode; when in
fullscreen the mouse is always locked.</p>
<p>Mouse speed</p>
<p>This slider allows player to set up mouse cursor speed in game. It
should be noted that this parameter is only applied if the game is run
in fullscreen mode.</p>
<p><strong>Other advanced settings</strong></p>
<p>Sprite cache max size</p>
<p>This option limits the maximum amount of memory that the game will use
for its sprite cache. Sprite cache is used to keep a partition of all
the game sprites loaded to the memory, thus reducing loading times
between rooms and preventing slowdowns during game play. Of course,
higher values make the game use more memory. Usually only
high-resolution games with long animations need to have this value
increased.</p>
<p>Custom game saves path</p>
<p>When unchecked, the game will store its files - saved games, and custom
runtime data - in the default Windows folders:
“C:/Users/&amp;lt;Username&amp;gt;/Saved Games/&amp;lt;Game Title&amp;gt;” and
“C:/Program Data/Adventure Game Studio/&amp;lt;Game Title&amp;gt;” respectively.
Players may enable this option and define their own location to store
game files.</p>
