<span id="animations"></span><h2>Animations<a class="headerlink" href="#animations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A graphical adventure game would be no good without animations. These
range from commonly-used animations such as the main character walking,
to a flag waving in the background in one particular screen.</p>
<p>Animations in AGS are managed using <em>Views</em>. A view is a set of one or
more <em>loops</em>. A loop is a set of frames which, when played in sequence,
give the illusion of movement. Expand the “Views” node in the project
tree, and double-click the view 1:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="_images/intro7_1.jpg" /><br>
<em>The View Editor showing view 1</em></p>
<p>This is the View Editor where you will put together all your animations.
You’ll notice lots of frames of Roger’s walking animation in this
window.</p>
<p>Each loop is displayed as a row of images (one for each frame), going
from left to right. To change the image for a frame, double-click the
image, and you’ll be presented with the sprite manager where you can
select the image to use. <strong>All images for use with views are imported as
usual via the sprite manager</strong> before they can be inserted into a
frame.<br>
At the right hand end of each loop, you’ll see a “Create new frame”
button, which you can click to create a new extra frame at the end of
the loop. You can also right-click a frame to insert a new one before or
after it.</p>
<p>Left-click a frame to select it. When you do so, the property grid will
be updated with the frame’s details:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="_images/intro7_2.jpg" /><br>
<em>Property Grid showing frame properties</em></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Delay</strong> is the frame’s <strong>relative</strong> speed. This number adds a
delay to the amount of time which the frame is displayed for,
therefore a larger number makes it stay longer. You can use negative
numbers to specifically shorten the frame’s display time.</li>
<li><strong>Sound</strong> allows you to assign a sound number that will get played
when this frame comes around in the animation. This feature is
designed for footstep sounds, but has many other uses as well. Using
sound will be covered later in the tutorial.</li>
<li><strong>Flipped</strong> toggles whether the frame is displayed normally or
mirrored left-right. This feature allows you to just create
animations for your character walking right, and then use the same
images for the walking left loop and AGS will automatically
flip them.</li>
</ul>
<p>Views aren’t only used for character walking animations – they’re used
for all types of animations in the game. How you actually run an
animation in the game will be explained later on.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="characters">
<span id="characters"></span><h2>Characters<a class="headerlink" href="#characters" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>If you remember back to part 3 of this tutorial, we talked about three
types of thing that the player can interact with - hotspots, objects and
characters. We’ve covered the first two, so now it’s time to take a look
at characters.</p>
<p>Put simply, a character is similar to an object, except that it can move
between different rooms in the game, take part in conversations, carry
its own inventory and more.</p>
<p>Expand the “Characters” node in the project tree. You’ll see that so far
you only have one character in the list, labelled “0: cEgo”. You can
create a new character by right-clicking the “Characters” node. For now,
double-click the “cEgo” character:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="_images/intro7_3.jpg" /><br>
<em>The Character Editor</em></p>
<p>The first thing you’ll notice is the text “This character is the player
character” at the top of the window. This shows that the currently
selected character is the initial player character when the game starts
up. The game will start off in whatever room number the <em>Starts in room</em>
option is set to for the player character. To change it, simply open up
the character that you want to use instead and click the “Make this the
player character” button.</p>
<p>There are quite a few properties available in the property grid. Rather
than explain them all here, we’ll just cover the most important ones -
you can find a full description of all the options in the manual.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>StartingRoom</strong> - this sets which room number the character starts
off in at the beginning of the game.</li>
<li><strong>NormalView</strong> - sets which view is used for the normal walking
animation of the character. The view specified here must have 4 or 8
loops, and the first frame of each loop is the standing still
frame.<br>
For a 4-loop character, when walking diagonally the closest straight
direction is chosen for display. With an 8-loop character, all 8
directions are displayed depending on the character’s direction.<br>
Which loop represents which direction is shown in the Views editor
(eg. “Loop 0 (down)”).</li>
<li><strong>Clickable</strong> - if this is not checked, then this character will be
see-through to mouse clicks. This is similar to the way the player
character worked in Lucasarts games - you cannot actually click on
Guybrush, it will always activate whatever is behind him.</li>
</ul>
<p>The character’s “<em>RealName</em>” field simply gives you an easy way to
identify the character in the editor, and can also be accessed from the
game script if desired.</p>
<p>The “<em>ScriptName</em>” field is very important, as it sets the name by which
the character will be referred to in the game scripts. The reason for
having this as well as the RealName is that the script name can only
contain the letters A-Z, whereas the <em>RealName</em> field can contain any
spaces, numbers, etc.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="game-starting-point">
<span id="game-starting-point"></span><h2>Game starting point<a class="headerlink" href="#game-starting-point" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Just in case you missed it, I’ll repeat what was just said in the
Characters section - the “<em>Starts in room</em>” setting of the player
character is used to determine which room the game starts off in.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="_images/icon_info.gif" /><br>
TIP: This feature can be handy for testing various parts of your game. For example, when you’re working on room 16, set the starting room to room 16 so that you can get to it instantly when you run the game to test it.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="cutscenes">
<span id="cutscenes"></span><h2>Cutscenes<a class="headerlink" href="#cutscenes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>You can easily add intro, outro and cutscene sequences to your game.
There is no specific feature to do this - you simply use the provided
animation and movement commands to do whatever you like.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="_images/icon_info.gif" /><br>
A cutscene is simply the name given to a sequence of actions over which the player has no control. This usually applies to the entire introduction sequence, as well as far simpler in-game events. For example, if the player goes to pick up a rock from the ground, you may wish to use a bending-down animation to show him picking it up. During this bending down and standing back up, the player cannot control proceedings, so it is a cutscene.</p>
<p>Right, firstly let’s do something very simple. When the player goes to
pick up the key from the floor of our room, we want him to walk over to
it first rather than it just disappearing from wherever he’s standing.</p>
<p>So, we want to add something extra to picking up the key. How do we do
this? Yes, that’s right, we need to return to the Event Script for the
key object. Go back to the Events List for the key object (remember, you
open the room, select the “Objects” mode, then click on the key to
select it):</p>
<p><img alt="" src="_images/intro7_4.jpg" /><br>
<em>Remember this?</em></p>
<p>The main difference you’ll notice now is that the “Interact object”
event already has a name. This “oKey_Interact” is the name of the
script function that we created earlier. So, just select it and click
the “…” button to return to the script editor.</p>
<p>Now, we want the player to walk across to the key <strong>before</strong> it
disappears, so we need to add a new line of script <strong>before</strong> the
existing command that makes the key invisible. We want to do an action
on the player character (ie. move him), so type “player.” and
auto-complete will pop up with the available commands. See if you can
work out which one we need.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="_images/intro7_5.jpg" /><br>
<em>The Walk command needs X and Y co-ordinates</em></p>
<p><strong>Eeek!</strong> It wants a destination X and Y location! We don’t know that,
but we can find out! Click the “Room 1” tab on the tab bar at the top of
the editor, and move the mouse cursor to where the key is on the
background. Look just above the background image, and you should see
“Mouse Position: 158, 108” or something similar. These are the X and Y
co-ordinates, respectively, of the key’s location. So, note them down,
and click the “room1.asc” tab to return to the script.</p>
<p>Now, we can type in those co-ordinates to our script. We also need to
pass in the BlockingStyle as <em>eBlock</em>, which tells the game to wait for
Roger to get to those co-ordinates before continuing the script. If we
didn’t do this, he would start to walk but the key would disappear
before he got there! The final script should look like this:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="_images/intro7_6.jpg" /><br>
<em>Our new command is run before the existing ones</em></p>
<p>Now, hit F5 and try it out!</p>
<p>OK, I think we’ve had enough of animations and cutscenes for now. We’ll
return later to explore actual animations and more complex cutscenes.</p>
